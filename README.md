An S3-compatible Gateway based on Ceph RGW, using a non-RADOS backend for
standalone usage.

This project provides the required infrastructure to build a container
able to run on a kubernetes cluster, providing S3-compatible endpoints to
applications.

## Roadmap

![Roadmap](/assets/images/s3gw-roadmap.jpg)

The aim is to deliver a Minumum Viable Product (MVP). In a nutshell, an MVP
seeks to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about our users in a
short time.

Based on the user feedback we collect, we develop features that add up towards
the goal of delivering the MVP. We're working on phases:

### Phase 1

- Use SQLite as storage backend.
- Running the s3gw in a container.
- Be able to run basic S3 operations.
- Ability to deploy the S3 Gateway on a K8s or K3s cluster with.
- [Design mockups][1] for User management & an S3 explorer.

-----

### Phase 2

- Basic S3 explorer UI
- Helm chart
- Define & start work on a file-based backend
- Implement CI/CD

-----

### Phase 3

- File-based backend integration
- Increased support for S3 functional features
- S3 explorer UI
- User management UI
- tba

-----

### Project Board

We track our progress in this [Github project][2] board.

## Quickstart

### Helm chart

An easy way to deploy the S3 Gateway on your Kubernetes cluster is via a Helm
chart. We've created a dedicated repository for it, which can be found
[here][3].

### Podman

```shell
podman run --replace --name=s3gw -it -p 7480:7480 ghcr.io/aquarist-labs/s3gw:latest
```

i### Docker

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/aquarist-labs/s3gw:latest
```

In order to run the Docker container:

```shell
docker run -p 7480:7480 localhost/s3gw
```

For more information on building and running a container, please read our
[guide](./build/).
